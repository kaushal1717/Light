//! `fleet impact`'s caller resolution, split out of `context_cmd.rs` to keep both files under
//! the 80-line gate (same reason `repomap_parse.rs` was split out of `repomap.rs`).
//!
//! `build_repo_map` already returns `edges: Vec<(SymbolId, SymbolId)>` -- caller, callee. Before
//! this module the command loaded those edges and never read them: it counted symbols whose name
//! matched and reported that. So `impact --symbol build` answered "5", meaning five functions are
//! *named* `build`, while the repo holds 26 places that *call* one. The count was a fact about
//! the name, not about the blast radius.
//!
//! **What an edge does and does not carry.** It is a pair of ids -- caller, callee -- and nothing
//! else. There is no call location in it, so this reports the functions that call the target and
//! where each of *those* is defined. It deliberately does not say "line 7 and line 8 of
//! `caller_two`": the graph does not know that, and naming the field `call_sites` would have
//! implied it did. One calling function is one row however many times it calls.
